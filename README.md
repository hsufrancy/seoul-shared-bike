# ðŸš² Seoul Shared Bike Usage Classification
This repository is for my final project in Machine Learning course at Seoul National University.

### Introduction
Currently, rental bikes have been introduced in many urban cities to enhance mobility comfort. Ensuring that rental bikes are available and accessible to the public at the right time is crucial, as it reduces waiting
times. Consequently, maintaining a stable supply of rental bikes throughout the city has become a significant concern. A critical aspect of this is predicting the number of bikes needed each hour to ensure
a consistent supply.

The resaon why I choose this dataset as my term project is because being an exchange student to Korea, I want to do some projects related to Korean social issues, and then I found something in common with my
home country, Taiwan. In Taiwan, we have a shard bike network called Ubike, which is so ubiquitous that people take advantage of it almost every day. But sometimes, I cannot find even one Ubikeâ€™s bicycle on
all surrounding stops. It indeicates that perhaps the government does not accurately estimate the demand of shared bikes and assign them to each stop accordingly. Being inspired by the similar problem in
Taiwan, I would like to perform classification using Seoul Bike Sharing Dataset and try to address this issue by logistic regression we learned during classes.
